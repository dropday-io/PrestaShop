# How to contribute

### Create an issue

By creating an issue a Dropday employee will assess the bug report or feature request. Maybe there is a solution already, a solution on the way or we find that it is not relevant.

If we find the issue relevant, we can start creating a PR.

### Creating a pull request

Once an issue is created and validated by a Dropday employee, you can create a pull request! Consider the following things:

1. Use [semantic commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
2. Use PrestaShop standards, [validate your module](https://validator.prestashop.com/)
3. Optional: Explain how to test the solution, if this is relevant
