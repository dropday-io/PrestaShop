# About this module

This module is a bridge between PrestaShop and Dropday. The API docs can be found here: https://docs.dropday.io.

Send orders to Dropday is the core feature of this module.

## Docker

Interact with the application that Dropday module runs in when developing using Docker:

```bash
docker compose exec {command}
```

## CI/CD

Do not bump the version of this module! That is done manually once a release is desired by the team.
